* **MVP**: Model View Presenter pattern from the base sample.
* **Domain**: Holds all business logic. The domain layer starts with classes named *use cases* or *interactors* used by the application presenters. These *use cases* represent all the possible actions a developer can perform from the presentation layer.
* **Repository**: Repository pattern from the base sample.

Tests are written with Espresso.
